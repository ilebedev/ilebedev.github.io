Oh hi! My name is Ilia, and I do many things at the [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/). I sail, build guitars, draw things on things, drink coffee over philosophy with friends, and teach anything I can to whomever wants to learn.

This site is a little bare, as I am currently swamped designing and teaching a pilot computer science course: [6.S04/6.0009, Fundamentals of Programming](https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa15/6.S04/), which will become a part of the required curriculum for MIT's computer science program.

I am also busy orchestrating the idealistic collaborative project that is [hackartscience](http://hackartscience.com), working on my main [research project](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/564): isolation containers for secure computation in an untrusted environment, and fixing my $100 [boat](http://boat.hackartscience.com).

Thank you for your interest!
