Oh hello! My name is Ilia, and I do many things at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence lab. I build guitars, make various art sporadically, drink coffee over philosophy with friends, and teach anything I can to whomever wants to learn.

Here are some things:

My resume is [here](/resume/).

My disorganized sailing club is [here](http://boat.csail.mit.edu)

There will surely be more things here soon.
