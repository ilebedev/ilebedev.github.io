      <b>Secure computation with minimal hardware support</b> May 2014 – Present
      <br>
      Advisor: prof. Srinivas Devadas – MIT
      <br>
      Investigating trusted computing with commodity CPUs in the context of Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX). The vision for this project is to be able to execute trusted, verified applications in a secure environment that prevents information leakage via direct snooping by the host OS, including information leakage via the memory side channel.

      <b>EM2 – Execution Migration Machine Compiler and Library</b> Jan. 2011 – May 2014
      <br>
      Advisor: prof. Srinivas Devadas – MIT
      <br>
      My MS  thesis work, an optimizing compiler for MIT’s EM2 architecture - a 110-core coherent shared memory system without the use of directories by employing deadlock-free migration of execution contexts to avoid data replication and movement. I also built optimized synchronization primitives for EM2 and explored compressed instruction encoding schemes to improve utility of each migration (C/C++, LLVM, Python).

      <b>MARC – A Manycore Approach to Reconfigurable Computing</b> Sep. 2009 – May 2011
      <br>
      Advisor: John Wawrzynek – UC Berkeley
      <br>
      My BS capstone project, a design methodology for FPGA and ASIC application-specific computers using a multicore architectural template serving as a target for a high-level optimizing compiler. Rapid prototyping and design-space exploration of data-parallel integer applications is easy with this OpenCL-based language and a C-to-gates compiler generating optimized fixed-function datapaths for data-parallel software programs. (C++, OpenCL, Verilog).

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>TA, MIT 6.006</b>: Intro to Algorithms (Spring 2014)
      <br>
      I ran a Python-based class a class of 300 students focused on introductory and intermediate applied algorithms and programming. I held 4 lectures per week (to complement the main lecture taught by MIT faculty), designed theoretical and applied assignments, designed exam problems, administered the course. Prof. of record: Srini Devadas, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Nancy Lynch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Grader, MIT 6.857</b>: Computer and Network Security (Spring 2012)
      <br>
      I graded weekly open-ended design problems in areas of cryptosystems and systems security.
Prof of record: Ron Rivest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Head TA, Berkeley CS150</b>: Computer Systems Design (2008-2010)
      <br>
      I helped teach a C and Verilog-based senior design class of 40-80 students demystifying the operation of computer systems from compiler output to RTL-level implementation. Students implemented a complete computer system on an FPGA platform from scratch, and targeted it with low-level software. I helped modernize the course, designed the semester-long course projects, On a weekly basis, I taught one lab lecture, two recitations, two three-hour laboratory sections.
