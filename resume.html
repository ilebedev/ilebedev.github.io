      <b>Secure computation with minimal hardware support</b> May 2014 – Present
      <br>
      Advisor: prof. Srinivas Devadas – MIT
      <br>
      Investigating trusted computing with commodity systems via strong isolation containers requiring no significant trusted software. The vision for this project is to enable trusted, verified applications in an untrusted environment, preventing information leakage via a malicious OS or Hypervisor by way of memory access patterns and shared resources (C/C++, RISC V, RTL).

      <br>
      My MS  thesis work, an optimizing compiler for MIT's EM2 architecture - a 110-core coherent shared memory system without the use of directories via deadlock-free migration of execution contexts. I also built optimized synchronization primitives for EM2 and investigated compressed instruction encoding schemes to improve utility of each migration (C/C++, LLVM, Python).

  <h3 class="side-by-side-heading">Teaching Experience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>TA, MIT 6.009/6.S04</b>: Fundamentals of Programming - funprog (Fall 2015, Spring 2016)
      <br>
      I am involved with the design, implementation, and teaching of a pilot course to replace MIT’s intro to computer science curriculum. The course is scalable by design, and is an experiment in methods for accessible education in computer science at a university level. The course aims to develop students’ capacity for  problem solving and independent work, preparing them for advanced coursework and internships. Prof. of record: Srini Devadas, Adam Chlipala
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>TA, MIT 6.006</b>: Intro to Algorithms (Spring 2014)
      <br>
      I ran a Python-based class a class of 300 students focused on introductory and intermediate applied algorithms and programming. I held 4 lectures per week (to complement the main lecture taught by MIT faculty), designed theoretical and applied assignments, designed exam problems, administered the course. Prof. of record: Srini Devadas, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Nancy Lynch.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Grader, MIT 6.857</b>: Computer and Network Security (Spring 2012)
      <br>
      I graded weekly open-ended design problems in areas of cryptosystems and systems security.
Prof of record: Ron Rivest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Head TA, Berkeley CS150</b>: Computer Systems Design (2008-2010)
      <br>
      I helped teach a C and Verilog-based senior design class of 40-80 students demystifying the operation of computer systems from compiler output to RTL-level implementation. Students implemented a complete computer system on an FPGA platform from scratch, and targeted it with low-level software. I helped modernize the course, designed the semester-long course projects, On a weekly basis, I taught one lab lecture, two recitations, two three-hour laboratory sections.
