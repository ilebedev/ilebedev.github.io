<p>
Oh hello! My name is Ilia, and I do many things at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence lab. I build guitars, make various art sporadically, drink coffee over philosophy with friends, and teach anything I can to whomever wants to learn.
</p>


<p>
Here are some things:
</p>

<p>
My resume is <a href="resume.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
My disorganized sailing club is <a href="http://boat.csail.mit.edu">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There will surely be more things here soon.
